Introduction: Business Problem
Car accidents occurs everywhere worldwide and is one of the leading causes for people. According to World Health Organization (WHO), roughly 1.35 million people die from traffic collisons. More than half of road traffic deaths involve users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Road traffic accidents also attribute to 3% of the domestic product. The goal is to identity relevant factors and derive insight on what events lead to these car accident and what severity is depended on.

The main audience of this project is road services, rescue services and city administration.

Questions:
What is the most common cause?
Are there relationships between causes?
What are the first things to look for to prevent car accidents?
Data
The dataset, containing roughly ~250,000 records as of Oct 2020, was used for analysis. It contains data collected from 2004 to 2020 and is based on accidents taken place in the state of Washington, Seattle. For each car accident, a severity (1 = prop damage and 2 = injury) code is assigned as well as other relevant information such as:

location
speeding involved
road condition
collision type
weather condition
lighting condition
driver inattention
number of people involved
These data points will be analyzed to what the major influences in car collisions.
